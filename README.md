# Shock-Bullet
The Shock bullet game is a classic side-scrolling platformer. 
Platforms and enemies enter the game from the right, moving to the left. 
The player can move left and right, jump, and shoot. 
If the player reaches the left edge of the game, they can’t move left any more.
Obviously, if the player isn’t supported by a platform, they fall to their death (and lose a life)! 
Enemies hit the player, and the player loses health on each hit.
When the player’s health reaches 0, they lose a life. 
The player has 3 lives to lose before they lose the game.
